### The Wizards' Wallet

This project is very incomplete. It is intended to be a usable-but-dangerous
Bitcoin wallet with a focus on supporting experimental user-facing features,
to explore UI designs but mostly just for fun.

It is also the primary use case for the [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/apoelstra/rust-bitcoin)
library.

### Building

To build, start by obtaining [cargo](http://crates.io/). Then just run `cargo build`.
To run the test cases, do `cargo test`. Note that the tests must pass (and reasonably
complete unit tests provided for new features) before any submissions can be accepted.

### Pull Requests

Realistically, this project is in heavy flux and not yet in a state where it can
accept pull requests. I will probably simply close any that are submitted, though
I'll try to leave a friendly note.
