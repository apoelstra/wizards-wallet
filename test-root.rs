//! # The Wizards' Wallet
//!
//! The Wizards' Wallet is a SPV Bitcoin Wallet designed for ease of prototyping
//! and a willingness to experiment with user interfaces, and exposing potentially
//! dangerous or experimental ideas built on top of the Bitcoin protocol.
//!
//! It is also written entirely in Rust to illustrate the benefits of strong type
//! safety, including ownership and lifetime, for financial and/or cryptographic
//! software.
